 What is Git Commit?
 
 A Git commit is a snapshot of the project that records changes made to tracked files along with a unique identifier and message.

This screenshot shows how commits are created in Git.

Each circle (C0, C1, C2, C3) represents a commit made one after another.

The (main*) label shows the current branch, and it points to the latest commit (C3).

Every time git commit is used, a new commit is added and the main branch moves forward.

This helps us understand how Git keeps track of changes.
